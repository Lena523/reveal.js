            The Open Web Application Security Project, OWASP for short, is an
            open and non-profit foundation and community dedicated to helping
            organizations, developers and just about anyone interested in AppSec
            improve the security of their software and build secure
            applications.

          <section data-background-gradient="linear-gradient(to bottom, #101012, #505E53)">
            Launched in 2001, OWASP is a well-known entity in the AppSec and
            developer community. With a program that includes many local
            chapters throughout the world (275 to be exact) as well as numerous
            open source projects and educational and training conferences,
            everyone is encouraged to participate and join this foundation
            boasting more than ten thousand members.

          <section data-background-gradient="linear-gradient(to bottom, #101012, #505E53)">
            What makes OWASP so respected and resourceful for both amateur and
            professional developers is that they hold true to their core values,
            which dictates that all of their projects, tools, documents and
            chapters are open and free for anyone interested in learning about
            application security.

            Engaging with their projects and chapters is a great way to not only
            learn, but to also network and build your reputation in the
